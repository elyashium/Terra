                <div className="what-carbon-txt">A carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases (including carbon dioxide and methane) that are generated by our actions.
                    The average carbon footprint for a person in the United States is 16 tons, one of the highest rates in the world. Globally, the average carbon footprint is closer to 4 tons. To have the best chance of avoiding a 2â„ƒ rise in global temperatures, the average global carbon footprint per year needs to drop to under 2 tons by 2050.
                    Lowering individual carbon footprints from 16 tons to 2 tons doesnâ€™t happen overnight! By making small changes to our actions, like eating less meat, taking fewer connecting flights and line drying our clothes, we can start making a big difference.
                    Key contributors to an individual's carbon footprint include:
                    Energy use (electricity, heating, and cooling).
                    Transportation (cars, airplanes, and public transit).
                    Diet choices (meat, dairy, and food waste).
                    Consumption patterns (clothing, electronics, and packaging).
